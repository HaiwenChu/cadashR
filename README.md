The California Department of Education provides five colors of "dashboard" ratings based upon various indicators for schools and districts for subgroups.

For example, for mathematics achievement, two variables are considered:
1) Change from prior year
2) Subgroup distance from standard

Each of these categories is divided into five groups, which subsequently create twenty-five regions that are each assigned either a rating of red, orange, yellow, green, or blue.

This R package helps to visualize the overall rating by plotting the two variables for selected subgroups on a plot in which the cut points are displayed as vertical and horizontal lines.
